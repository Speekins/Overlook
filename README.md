### Abstract
The fictional Overlook Hotel website allows customers to log in and see their upcoming reservations, past reservations, and book a new reservation for themselves. Additionally, the customer is shown how much in total they have spent at the Overlook.
The Overlook's manager can also log in to view the manager dashboard. The dashboard gives a snapshot of the day including how many of the 25 rooms are currently available, the percent of rooms booked for the day, and how much revenue the hotel is bringing in for the day. The manager is also able to search for any customer by their first name, view the customers upcoming reservations, and book new reservations or delete reservations for that customer

This solo project was created as the final project in the second module (of four) of the Turing front-end software engineering program. This project is the culmination of gained experience and knowledge over the past six weeks listed under the `Technologies` heading below.
